## My process

### Built with

- No Javascript
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Using checked, you have to make sure what you want to change is inside the div with the button.
- In this case, I just removed the ending div tag to get the checked to propagate.
- Padding adjustments / make sure to center content

### Continued development

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Rework HTML
